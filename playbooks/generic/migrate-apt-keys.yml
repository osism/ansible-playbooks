# This is a workaround to migrate existing installations.
#
# Required because of the deprecation of apt-key. Only necessary on
# Ubuntu 22.04. Only necessary once.
#
# Only necessary for existing installations. For new installations,
# the execution is not necessary. New systems already get the keys
# in the right place.
